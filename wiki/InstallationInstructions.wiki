#summary Installation instructions for users and developers.

There are two ways to obtain a copy of Archimetrix: Either you install a bundled-up, ready-to-use feature into your Eclipse workbench, or you piece a development version together from different sources. This page describes first the user installation and, after that, the development installation.
