#summary Installation instructions for users and developers.

There are two ways to obtain a copy of Archimetrix: Either you install a bundled-up, ready-to-use feature into your Eclipse workbench, or you piece a development version together from different sources. This page describes first the user installation and, after that, the development installation.

= User Installation =

If you only want to try out Archimetrix without actively developing it, there is an Eclipse feature of Archimetrix available for easy installation. Before you install the Archimetrix feature, you need to install few more more steps, as follows
  
   * Download and install the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/keplerr Eclipse Modeling Tools (Kepler)] by choosing your target OS on the right side download links section.
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and from the category Modelling under Eclipse Kepler update site install Xtext, Xpand, MoDisco SDK, and QVT Operational SDK. 
   * Download the Medini plugins (just the plugins!!) from [http://projects.ikv.de/qvt/downloads medini website] and put them in the plugins folder of your Eclipse.
   * Select Help -> Eclipse Marketplace... and install Palladio 3.5.
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install Gast model  feature from the [http://sissy.sourceforge.net/SISSy_Nightly update site].
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install SAMM feature from the [http://q-impress.ow2.org/updateSite update site]. 
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install Archimetrix from our [https://archimetrix.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ArchimetrixForKepler/ArchimetrixUpdateSite/ update site].

   * After restarting your Eclipse, you can choose the Archimetrix perspective and the Archimetrix menu will show up. New users may follow the [https://code.google.com/p/archimetrix/wiki/UserGuide User guide] to learn more about the features of Archimetrix.

   * Remark: Depending on the size of your project, you may face memory issues which you can solve by changing the memory allocated for your Eclipe. We use the following VM arguments for our Eclipse: -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m.

= Developer Installation =

In order to set up the Eclipse Kepler environment to develop Archimetrix, you need to execute the following steps 

   * Download and install the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/keplerr Eclipse Modeling Tools (Kepler)] by choosing the your target OS on the right side download links section.
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and from the category Modelling under Eclipse Kepler update site install Xtext, Xpand, MoDisco SDK, and QVT Operational SDK.
   * Install SoMoX. You may to this using the update site like in the User installation guide or get the source code of SoMoX. If you choose the second option import all plugins of SoMoX from the trunk folder of [https://svnserver.informatik.kit.edu/i43/svn/code/SoMoX/Core/trunk/ SoMoX repository] (anonymous, anonymous).
   * This step is necessary only if you are using the source code of SoMoX. Download the Medini plugins (just the plugins!!) from [http://projects.ikv.de/qvt/downloads medini website] and put them in the plugins folder of your Eclipse.
   * Import all plugins of the Palladio Workflow Engine from [https://svnserver.informatik.kit.edu/i43/svn/code/WorkflowEngine/trunk/ here].
   * Select Help -> Eclipse Marketplace... and install Palladio 3.5.
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install Gast model  feature from the [http://sissy.sourceforge.net/SISSy_Nightly update site].
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install SAMM feature from the [http://q-impress.ow2.org/updateSite update site].
   * The last step is to import the necessary plugins from three projects: Story diagrams, Reclipsed, and Archimetrix. Follow the next section for this step.

== Workspace plug-ins ==

You need plug-ins from three projects: The story diagrams metamodel and interpreter, Reclipse, and Archimetrix itself.

=== Story diagrams ===

The plug-ins for the story diagram metamodel and interpreter can be found [https://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/sdm-commons/ in this repository]. Contact one of the project owners if you need write access.

From the story diagrams repository, you need the following plug-ins:

=== Reclipse ===

Reclipse can be obtained from [https://svn-serv.cs.upb.de/reclipse-emf/ this repository]. (You will need an account. When in doubt, consult with [mailto:jm@uni-paderborn.de JÃ¼rgen Maniera].)
From Reclipse, only the plug-ins for the formalization, generation, and detection of structural patterns are necessary.

=== Archimetrix ===

Archimetrix is available in the repository belonging to [https://archimetrix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ this project]. You will need the following plug-ins:

=== Run Archimetrix ===

Now, you can run Archimetrix as an Eclipse application by creating a new Eclipse instance in the Run configurations. We recommend the following VM arguments: -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.5 -Dhelp.lucene.tokenizer=standard -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize =512m.
