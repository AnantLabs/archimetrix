#summary Installation instructions for users and developers.

There are two ways to obtain a copy of Archimetrix: Either you install a bundled-up, ready-to-use feature into your Eclipse workbench, or you piece a development version together from different sources. This page describes first the user installation and, after that, the development installation.

   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and from category Modelling from Eclipse Kepler update site install Xtext and Xpand features.

In order to set up the Eclipse Kepler environment to develop Archimetrix, you need to execute the following steps 

   * Download and install the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/keplerr Eclipse Modeling Tools (Kepler)] by choosing the your target OS on the right side download links section.
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and from category Modelling from Eclipse Kepler update site install Xtext and Xpand features.
   * Click on Install Modeling Components button and install MoDisco and QVTo.
   * Download the Medini plugins (just the plugins!!) from [http://projects.ikv.de/qvt/downloads medini website] and put them in the plugins folder of your Eclipse.
   * Install SoMoX. You may to this using the update site like in the User installation guide or get the source code of SoMoX. If you choose the second option import all plugins of SoMoX from the trunk folder of [https://svnserver.informatik.kit.edu/i43/svn/code/SoMoX/Core/trunk/ SoMoX repository] (anonymous, anonymous).
   * Import all plugins of the Palladio Workflow Engine from [https://svnserver.informatik.kit.edu/i43/svn/code/WorkflowEngine/trunk/ here].
   * Install Palladio 3.4 from Eclipse Marketplace.
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install Gast model  feature from the [http://sissy.sourceforge.net/SISSy_Nightly update site].
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install SAMM feature from the [http://q-impress.ow2.org/updateSite update site].
   * The last step is to import the necessary plugins from three projects: Story diagrams, Reclipsed, and Archimetrix. Follow the next section for this step.

== Workspace plug-ins ==

You need plug-ins from three projects: The story diagrams metamodel and interpreter, Reclipse, and Archimetrix itself.

=== Story diagrams ===

The plug-ins for the story diagram metamodel and interpreter can be found [https://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/sdm-commons/ in this repository]. Contact one of the project owners if you need write access.

From the story diagrams repository, you need the following plug-ins:

=== Reclipse ===

Reclipse can be obtained from [http://dsd-serv.uni-paderborn.de/svn/reclipse-emf this repository]. (You will need an account. When in doubt, consult with [mailto:jm@uni-paderborn.de JÃ¼rgen Maniera].)
From Reclipse, only the plug-ins for the formalization, generation, and detection of structural patterns are necessary.
