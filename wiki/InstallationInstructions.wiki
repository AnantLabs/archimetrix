#summary Installation instructions for users and developers.

There are two ways to obtain a copy of Archimetrix: Either you install a bundled-up, ready-to-use feature into your Eclipse workbench, or you piece a development version together from different sources. This page describes first the user installation and, after that, the development installation.

= User Installation =

If you only want to try out Archimetrix without actively developing it, there is an Eclipse feature of Archimetrix available for easy installation. You can install it as follows
  
   * Download and install the [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/helios/sr1 Eclipse Modeling Tools in version 3.6.1].
   * Select Help -> Install New Software... and install Archimetrix from our [http://dsd-serv.uni-paderborn.de/svn/updatesites/tags/Archimetrix_Release_1.3 update site].

= Developer Installation =

In order to develop Archimetrix, you need a range of features and plug-ins. 

== Features ==

Since some of the plug-ins make use of Xtext and Xpand, you need the respective features in your installation.

In addition, you need the Palladio Workflow Engine which is used in SoMoX and, optionally, SoMoX itself. The workflow engine is available on this [http://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/workflowengine/releases/1.4/ update site].

SoMoX can either be installed as a feature from this [http://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/somox/nightly/ update site], or the relevant plug-ins can be checked out from the repository (see [InstallationInstructions#Somox_(optional) below]).
