#summary Installation instructions for users and developers.

There are two ways to obtain a copy of Archimetrix: Either you install a bundled-up, ready-to-use feature into your Eclipse workbench, or you piece a development version together from different sources. This page describes first the user installation and, after that, the development installation.

= Developer Installation =

In order to develop Archimetrix, you need a range of features and plug-ins. 

== Features ==

Since some of the plug-ins make use of Xtext and Xpand, you need the respective features in your installation.

From Eclipse Marketplace you need to install Palladio Component Model. 

In addition, you need the SoMoX feature which is available on this [http://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/somox/nightly/ update site], Gast model feature available on this [http://sissy.sourceforge.net/SISSy_Nightly update site] and Qimpress SAMM feature available on this [http://q-impress.ow2.org/updateSite update site].



== Workspace plug-ins ==

You need plug-ins from three: The story diagrams metamodel and interpreter, Reclipse and Archimetrix itself.

=== Story diagrams ===

The plug-ins for the story diagram metamodel and interpreter can be found [https://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/sdm-commons/ in this repository]. Contact one of the project owners if you need write access.

Reclipse can be obtained from [http://dsd-serv.uni-paderborn.de/svn/reclipse-emf this repository]. (You will need an account. When in doubt, consult with [mailto:jm@uni-paderborn.de JÃ¼rgen Maniera].)
From Reclipse, only the plug-ins for the formalization, generation, and detection of structural patterns are necessary.
